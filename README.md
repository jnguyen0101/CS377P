# CS 377P: Programming for Performance

This repository contains the programming assignments completed for **CS 377P: Programming for Performance** at the **University of Texas at Austin**.

The course explores how modern computer architectures impact program efficiency and how to write high-performance software through optimization, benchmarking, and low-level systems programming.

## Course Topics

Assignments in this repository cover concepts such as:

- Performance measurement and benchmarking
- CPU caching and memory hierarchy
- Instruction-level parallelism and pipelining
- SIMD/vectorization
- Loop optimizations and blocking techniques
- Multithreading and parallel programming
- Low-level ARMv8-A assembly programming
- Performance tuning and profiling tools
